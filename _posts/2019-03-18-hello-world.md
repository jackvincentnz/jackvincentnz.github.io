**Hello World!**, welcome to the start of something great.

I will be using this blog to share my opinions and lessons learned as a software engineer over the past few years.

I am always looking for new ways to have some fun with my career. Sharing my challenges and successes is a good way to help others learn. I value learning from my mistakes and the reflection required to summarize my experiences is a great tool to maximise those learning opportunties.

The content should remain light-hearted. Noone should take life too seriously.

I hope you like it!

-Jack.
